# Visualization-using-matplotlib

In this task, data visualization is performed on the BigMart dataset using Matplotlib to explore and understand the underlying patterns in the data. Various types of plots are employed to visualize key relationships between features such as item type, outlet size, sales, and visibility. Bar plots are used to illustrate the distribution of item sales across different outlet types and sizes, providing insight into which stores perform better. Histograms reveal the distribution of sales and item visibility, helping to identify any skewness or outliers. Box plots are applied to examine the variation in sales across different item types, detecting potential trends or anomalies. Additionally, scatter plots help visualize the correlation between item visibility and sales, uncovering any possible linear or non-linear relationships. These visualizations offer a comprehensive understanding of the data, aiding in feature selection and model building for predicting sales.
